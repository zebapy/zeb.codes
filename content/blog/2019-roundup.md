As the decade comes to a close, every social media channel is adding their 2019 or decade round up of their respective niche products, etc. I figured since I'm attempting to write a bit now, I'd give my list of favorite tech I've seen, experimented with, or jumped on board with.


## [Figma](https://figma.com) üòç

I've been along time fan of [Sketch]() ever since I encountered it in 2014. Photoshop had become too cumbersome and lacked features which made UI design a grind in its software. With Sketch's simplified interface focusing on features cosntantly used to design digital UIs, artboards, and performance, transitioning to Sketch was a no brainer. This is happening a 2nd time now but with [Figma](). I believe I tried figma a year ago or so but only recently had they streamlined their tool and focused more on competing with Sketch. The main reasons for transitioning to Figma from sketch are few, but the impact is high.

### I can use it on Windows

I have a [custom built] Windows PC at home for coding and gaming. I do own an old 2015 MacBook pro. Unfortunately battery has lost its life and it has become sluggish as all get-out to work on and requires being plugged in. 

Figma uses the same electron based desktop app approach to ship to multiple operating systems. This is a huge win for me (and I assume them) since I can use a Mac and swap to a PC later to get right back into my design files. Oh, and since files are in the cloud, I don't need to make sure the files are in the right Dropbox folder or use [Abstract] for syncing. 

### It's in cloud

I already touched on the perks to the cloud storage in the previous pro

It's taking some time for web apps to come up speed (literal performance) with native apps but the gap is closing. With software liike [electron], many desktop apps are now made with almost purely web technologies (saying that makes me giddy and hopeful since years ago I used to question if getting into web dev was enough).

Figma is optionally downloadable as a desktop app (which still runs the same web app) and is also available at a simple URL. It's wicked fast to open up a design since 100% of the time I have a browser open anyway and just start to iterate on some idea or check some specs on a project.


I'm hopeful we'll move to Figma at my workplace once I can convince the team.

### Pricing

Figma's current pricing allows for 1 project (which is a _shared_ project, meant to be used with a team) and unlimited "files" which are essentially Sketch files. This pricing blows Sketch out of the water since Figma is always updated for free so features won't lag behind. My current work license expired so we're not getting bug fixes... really?

### Interface gripes

Nothing is without fault, even a few minor things. These of course do not prevent me from advocating for Figma but I hope they get cleaned up some day.

#### Page selector could match Sketch's

When the Pages are collapsed, you have to re-open them to swap to a different page. I don't know why they didn't straight up rip of Sketch with this functionality and added a dropdown button to swap to other pages quickly without having to expand the entire list each time.

#### UI is small and noisy

## Ultrawide monitors ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Static site Hosting

## Node based Static site generators

## ReactJS


## [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io)

I'd say codesandbox is comparable to Figma in the aspect that it's bringing a lot of great features to the cloud and browser that were originally only available as a native desktop app. Though I would not use it for full development production work (whereas I would absolutely use Figma for production work), it's an excellent web app that can get your minimal viable product up and running and pushed off to a host without having to do a lot of usual boilerplate. 

### Templates

Codesandbox's templates are one of its neatest features. It's 1 click to _already_ have a [create-react-app]() set up with all of its needed packages installed and scaffolding done. 

### VScode included

VScode has become one of the most popular text editors within the last few years and the fact Codesandbox uses it right in the web app is all the better. I haven't dug into it, but it'd be ince if you can sync settings from your own installation to the cloud version. Maybe a feature to come?



## Goodbye 2019 

It's been yet another tech packed year and it's only getting started. We're on on the brink of some scary changes coming to mankind with the advent of [quantum computer supremecy](https://www.livescience.com/google-hits-quantum-supremacy.html) and AI growth. Not to mention the political state of the US and globe. Sometimes you have to enjoy what you have and not worry about the big picture _too much_ otherwise it can stress you out. 

I hope you've all had a good one and I'll see you in the next one.
