- title: User Experience (UX)
  text: We build sites to serve customers. Customers have high expectations set by tech giants   which have teams to invest resources into the UX decision. You have to keep up with the status quo or be left behind. I stay on top of web trends and user experience patterns to ensure the projects I work on are up to snuff and won't lose your customers because of a outdated experience they have no idea how to navigate.
- title: Performance
  text: The slower your website, the higher probablity users will abandon. Numerous studies have shown that page speed also relates to revenue gains. Users browsing over slow mobile data also have a need to be fulfilled. The performance pillar is one I focus intensly on to ensure your site loads as fast as possible for the customer.
- title: Accessibility
  text: We owe it to fellow humans to not exclude them if we have a service they need access to. Accessibility is a core feature to be included in website builds, to make sure it is usable to those with visual, auditory, or other impairments. Font colors need to contrast. Navigation needs to be usable via keyboard or voice commands. These are just 2 examples of lengthy requirements to be tested against when it comes to your site.
- title: Responsive
  text: Browsing the web on a mobile device has grown exponentially over the last decade. Websites need to be device agnostic, adapting to any device or screen size they may be viewed on whether it's an old smart phone or the latest tablet. I build sites that are responsive, meaning it has one code base (instead of a separate mobile-only website which increases maintenance burden) to serve all screens.
- title: Search Engine Optimization (SEO),
  text: Websites need to built with specific code in specific areas to ensure search engines can interpet their content and rank them accordingly.
