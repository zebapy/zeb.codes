Fateseal is a [Magic: The Gathering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering) deck building website with social networking aspects. Fateseal's ultimate goal is to connect MTG players of all skill levels, introduce the game to new players, and improve existing players' skills through deck building, research and analysis of games, and peer review.

The project was founded by myself and a fellow MTG player/developer, and is maintained in our spare time and funded on the money out of our pockets. We are both very passionate about it and hope to someday turn it into a resource all MTG players look to.
