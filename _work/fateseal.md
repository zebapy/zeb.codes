Fateseal is a [Magic: The Gathering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering) deck building website with social networking aspects. Though it has a very niche target market, there are an estimated 12 million players. Fateseal's ultimate goal is to connect MTG players of all skill levels, introduce the game to new players, and improve existing players' skills through deck building, creative exploration, and peer review. On top of that, we plan on building the site to be a one-stop-shop type of resource to get the most out of MTG. 

The project is still in its infancy, as the other co-founded (a fellow MTG player and web developer) and I just launched it in May, 2015, we will be iterating on it going forward, and working with our small userbase to receive feedback and improve upon existing features.
