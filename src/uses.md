## Editor

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Vim keybindings](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim)
- Usually some dark theme like [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/)
- [Fira Code font](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)
- [View settings](https://gist.github.com/zebapy/9eb62f25ed47ee5470b0f5993818b7b0#file-settings-json)
- [View extensions](https://gist.github.com/zebapy/9eb62f25ed47ee5470b0f5993818b7b0#file-extensions-json)

## Terminal tools and setup

- zsh/[Oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) when I need some serious terminal window management
- [Brew](https://brew.sh/) on Mac
- [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/) on windows for software management
- On Windows, I use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) occasionally

## Deploy

1. [vercel](https://vercel.com/)
2. [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
3. [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

## Design

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is 100% my jam. Previously was using [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) but Figma has totally overtaken them in the past year (2019) with their multi platform support (I use a Windows PC at home and a Mac at work), cloud sycning, great pricing, and more.
- In ancient times, I designed MySpace layouts with Adobe Photoshop. Those were the days.

## Laptop

- I get whatever my work gives me for a Mac laptop
- I do own a 13" 2015 mac book pro but the battery is shot so it is retired in my closet.

## Desktop

My first pc build was in 2011, and in 2019, I decided to overhaul my desktop experience.

- After

### Peripherals/other

- LG 34GK950F-B 34" 21:9 WQHD Nano IPS Curved Monitor
  - I struggled with choosing this. I wanted 140hz for gaming and high res for productivity. I paid a little too much for this at the time and pay have been better suited with 2 QHD monitors (I was trying out an HP 2560x1080)
- Amazon Basics monitor arm
- Hyperx Cloud wired **headset** (used to have a corsair wireless headset but the battery life depleted quickly, charging port had problems, and the plastic snapped. Never again.)
- Logitech G Pro wireless **mouse**
- Ducky one 2 mini **keyboard** with cherry brown switches
- [aviator cable] from etsy
- aftermarket keyboard case
- 36" mousepad
- Custom 7x3.5' wood desk top made from pine 6x8"s. Dark stain.
- Fully Jarvis standing legs
- undermount surge protector
- undermount wire tray
- Autonomous **chair**. Switched from a DX racer. The cushion was a downgrade but otherwise a solid chair.
- Phillips hue lights. Annoyed with hub having to be connected with ethernet.
- USB switch for swapping keyboard/mouse from mac to pc. Stickied to the back of my monitor

## Other tools

- Chrome browser for development.
- Trello for project management for larger work or non code work. GitHub issues for code tasks usually.
- I subscribe to Spotify and listen to a variety of music. I'm all aboard the lo-fi train lately.
- Alfred mostly for an app starter, and occasional file finder
- Rectangles app for window management on Mac
- Bitwarden is my new password manager. I was using 1Password before but their device limit caused me to switch. I almost went with LastPass but BitWarden took it because pricing, nicer UI, and open source.
- Dropbox for non word/spreadsheet files. I use Google Drive almost exclusively for those instead.
- My notes are spread out -- due to experimenting with new note apps -- across Google Keep, Notion, and Trello. I want to make my own note app to sync with GitHub or Dropbox as markdown files.

### Other hardware

- Switched from iPhone 6+ to Pixel 2 XL. No turning back from vanilla (mostly) Android experience. As much as it stinks to give into the Google overlords, I wholly use their ecosystem (email, drive, calendar) so switching to Android made sense. I never used iCloud/iTunes, or any cross mac + iphone features.
- Pixel Buds are my first wireless earbud experience and, frankly, I'm disappointed. Connection issues, stereo sound swaps, fit issues. Perhaps other wireless earbuds aren't so bad but I wanted the Pixel integration like touch functions. I still use a very old pair of wired Apple earbuds for a fallback.
- PS4 (Favs: Last of Us, Uncharted, God of War, MGS, Horizon: Zero Dawn, RDR2, Beatsaber)
