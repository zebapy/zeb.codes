<!-- I've always enjoyed building things; from Legos as a youngin to my custom desktop PC as an adult (well, that _is_ just Legos for adults). There's something special about code and the web, though. Maybe it's something about the instant gratification you get from typing out code then seeing things come to life on the screen. Or the satisifaction you get from spending hours on a code problem (ok, it doesn't sound too great) but then finally solving it and getting that dopamine. Either way, I love to build things on the internet and with code. If you can think it, you can usually make it. -->

I'm a front-end focused developer with fullstack experience and a penchant for UI design, born and raised in rural Vermont, US. I am primarily self-taught with years of freelance and professional experience. I have a passion for writing code and tweaking pixels. I'm always hungry to code and learn more.

I'm currently working remotely for Burlington based startup [Faraday.ai](https://faraday.ai) where I build features and interfaces using React and Graphql to deliver consumer predictions to businesses.

I am also the creator of a project called [Fateseal](https://www.fateseal.com) of my free time. [Check it out in my projects.](/work/fateseal)
