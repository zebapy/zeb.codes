I'm first and foremost a front-end (whoa) developer with a penchant for UI design, born and raised in rural Vermont, US. I am primarily self-taught with 6 combined years of freelance and professional experience. I have a passion for writing code and tweaking pixels. I'm always hungry to code and learn more.

I am currently employed at Middlebury College as a web developer where I collaborate with my team to build micro sites, Wordpress themes, create frontend design systems (Coming Soonâ„¢) for numerous Drupal sites, and develop custom HTML emails. I enjoy working on tooling and finding ways to improve workflows.

I am also the creator/maintainer of a project called Fateseal which has consumed a lot of my free time. Check it out in my projects.
